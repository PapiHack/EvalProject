    <abstract>
      In this paper we address the problem of modelling and using
      overlap relationships between process workproducts. In fact, in the current
      MDE context, the nature of software processes has drastically changed; they
      involve workproducts which are essentially large-sized models with lots of
      relationships of different kinds. Particularly, we have focused on the
      overlap relationship which consists in sharing model elements between
      process workproducts. First, we show that if such relationship is
      completely specified during process modelling, then process engines are
      able to use it to ensure a more optimized workproducts management which is
      not supported by current process management approaches. Then we present our
      software process modelling and execution approach and describe the
      prototype of PSEE we have developed to show its feasibility.
